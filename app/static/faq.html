    <dt>Are the news articles dummy articles?</dt>
    <dd>The news articles are 100% authentic and have been sourced from established news agencies worldwide with the
        help of NewsAPI Service. However, there is no guarantee of the accuracy of facts portrayed in the said articles.
    </dd>
    <dt>Why can't I read the articles in detail, instead of just viewing article highlights and stubs?</dt>
    <dd>The service that this app relies on to fetch the headline articles only offers this feature to paid
        subscription. This app was written with the developer (limited) mode of the API. Hence, full article contents
        are not available.
    </dd>
    <dt>Why are some images missing?</dt>
    <dd>NewsStreme is not responsible for checking the integrity of the image source links.
