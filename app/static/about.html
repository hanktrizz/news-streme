<h2>About & Terms of Service</h2>
<p>
    This site was developed as an exercise in AngularJS for the V6 team by Thi Han Kyaw.
</p>
<p>
    Currently, it offers news articles on a as-is basis with total reliance on the third party NewsAPI. There are
    currently no provisions and contingency in the event of failure on NewsAPI&quot;s end. There are, however, plans to
    improve on the robustness of the app if time permits. News from sources are not verified prior to usage and
    manipulation in this app.
</p>
<p>
    The app was developed to meet the minimum requirements and does not currently have any other features outside of
    Featuring articles, organising and grouping news type (World/Australian/Local/All).
